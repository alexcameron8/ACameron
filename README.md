# Personal Website
This website is my first project using web development technologies. The goal of this project when I originally created the project in 2021 was to initially gain experience working with HTML, CSS and Javascript while also highlighting my personal portfolio. Over the past few years I have been continuously developing my skills through course work and personal learning. I used this project to focus on the application of various different web development concepts that I had little to no exposure to during my University studies. 

For instance, a feature that I have integrated consists of adding interactive behaviours and animations using Javascript, such as, hovering the mouse over various content to trigger use case dependent actions. Another concept I incorporated into this project to learn more about consists of developing a website that is responsive and can be accessed seamlessly on mobile and PC. This task had it's challenges, since I did not have approriate awareness of developing a responsive design when developing the initial version of the website. This particular experience has highlighted the importance of incoporating responsive designs from the very beginning of the project, rather than trying to retroactively update the design at the end.
