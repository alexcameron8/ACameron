                    My name is Alex Cameron and I am a 3rd year Software Engineering student studying at Carleton University and currently seeking a Coop position for the Summer 2021 semester. 
                    <br>
                    Work Availability: 4, 8, 12 or 16 months work terms starting in May 2021.

                <p class="title">Interests</p>
                <p class="mainAbout">
                    Growing up I played hockey, ultimate frisbee and played on various other school sport teams. During the year 2020 I have developed a strong passion for programing and participated in several hackathons which has allowed me to learn
                    to apply my programming knowledge outside of classwork and experiment with new projects in various languages.
                </p>
                <p class="title">Skills</p>
                <p class="mainAbout">
                   Most of my programming experience is with java leading to a strong understanding of the language. Through designing and programming personal projects and small scale applications, this has lead to an intermediate knowledge of C, Python and HTML and CSS.

                I have been playing ultimate frisbee since my first year of high school in 2015. I have played competitively since grade 10 when I played on Ottawa ignite for 3 years before transitioning into adult teams.
                <br><br>
                I now play for Carleton University's 'A' team and play with the top Ottawa open team, Phoenix. As well, in 2020 I made the Ottawa Outlaws which is Ottawa's professional ultimate frisbee team. However, due to Covid-19 I will have to wait until 2021 to
                play with them since the 2020 AUDL season was unfortunately canceled.
